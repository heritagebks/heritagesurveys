            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Heritage Surveys, Inc. opened its doors in October of 1976. Our headquarters is located in the scenic and peaceful Western Massachusetts town of Southampton. Inside, the staff works on a state-of-the art networked computer system while the field crew visits sites throughout Hampshire and Hampden counties, collecting data.
<div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Heritage Surveys works like a close-knit team. Most employees have worked at Heritage for more than ten years, with several having more than 20 years of experience and others dating back to its inception. As a result, we are able to provide a continuity of service that many clients greatly appreciate and we also often can build from an established base of information for individual projects.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The Founder and President of Heritage Surveys is Bruce Coombs. He is registered as a Professional Land Surveyor in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont. He is also a licensed Real Estate Broker and Certified Soil Evaluator in Massachusetts. When you come to Heritage Surveys, you will likely work closely with either Mark Annis, General Manager of Operations, or Mark Reed, Director of Engineering and Certified Soil Evaluator.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The Heritage staff works cooperatively with other consultants and professionals such as architects, engineers, attorneys, landscape architects, foresters, photogrammetrists and environmental professionals. We frequently will pull together a team of professionals to provide comprehensive supervision and coordination of all services for a particular project.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Heritage Surveys has been on the leading edge of technological improvement since its establishment. It was one of the first firms in the region to use and become proficient with the AutoCAD and Softdesk programs. For many years, our staff members have been obtaining field measurements of angles and distances electronically, then downloading the data into our state-of-the-art computer system. Employees have undergone training courses in the use of field and office equipment, and regularly attend courses and seminars to keep abreast of the latest improvements. Heritage Surveys has received several winning awards in the Cadastral Survey, Title Insurance Plan, and Engineering Site and Subdivision Plan categories at the MALSCE Conventions in recent years.</span></div><div>
